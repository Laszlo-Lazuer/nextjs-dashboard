### What is metadata?

In web development, metadata provides additional details about a webpage. Metadata is not visible to the users visiting the page. Instead, it works behind the scenes, embedded within the page's HTML, usually within the `<head>` element. This hidden information is crucial for search engines and other systems that need to understand your webpage's content better.

### Why is metadata important?

Metadata plays a significant role in enhancing a webpage's SEO, making it more accessible and understandable for search engines and social media platforms. Proper metadata helps search engines effectively index webpages, improving their ranking in search results. Additionally, metadata like Open Graph improves the appearance of shared links on social media, making the content more appealing and informative for users.

## Description

This repository will follow along with the NextJS Dashboard app [tutorial](https://nextjs.org/learn/dashboard-app) from the NextJS documentation. Each chapter of the tutorial is broken out as it's own branch. Incrementally building upon itself as the tutorial progresses.
