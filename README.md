# NextJS Primer for the FS Team

## Name

Chapter 5 - Navigating Between Pages

* How to use the `next/link` component.
* How to show an active link with the `usePathname()` hook.
* How navigation works in Next.js

### Why Optimize navigation?

To link between pages, you'd traditionally use the `<a>` HTML element. At the moment, the sidebar links use `<a>` elements, but notice what happens when you navigate between the home, invoices, and customers pages on your browser.

Did you see it?

There's a full page refresh on each page navigation!

1. Run `nvm use` at the root of this project.
2. Install pnpm if you would like to follow 1:1 with the tutorial:
   1. Run: `pnpm i`
      1. If you are using another package manager install the package.json dependencies as you would normally.
3. Startup the local dev build by running:
   1. `pnpm dev`

## Usage

The intent of this repository is to serve as a primer for NextJS.
