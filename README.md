## Name

Chapter 13 - Handling Errors

---

[Deployment Link](https://nextjs-dashboard-two-rho-68.vercel.app/)

---

## This chapter will cover

* How to use the special `error.tsx` file to catch errors in your route segments, and show a fallback UI to the user.
* How to use the `notFound` function and `not-found` file to handle 404 errors (for resources that donâ€™t exist).

## Description

This repository will follow along with the NextJS Dashboard app [tutorial](https://nextjs.org/learn/dashboard-app) from the NextJS documentation. Each chapter of the tutorial is broken out as it's own branch. Incrementally building upon itself as the tutorial progresses.

## Installation

1. Run `nvm use` at the root of this project.
2. Install pnpm if you would like to follow 1:1 with the tutorial:
   1. Run: `pnpm i`
      1. If you are using another package manager install the package.json dependencies as you would normally.
3. Startup the local dev build by running:
   1. `pnpm dev`

## Usage

The intent of this repository is to serve as a primer for NextJS.
